# A brief description of the change.  Surround your text with quotes ("") if it needs to start with a backtick (`).
note: "It's recommended to have the `max_staleness` setting configured when using the `cumulativetodelta` processor in order to avoid increased memory consumption when processing metrics."

# Mandatory: One or more tracking issues related to the change. You can use the PR number here if no issue exists.
issues: [738]

# (Optional) One or more lines of additional information to render under the primary note.
# These lines will be padded with 2 spaces and then inserted directly into the document.
# Use pipe (|) for multiline entries.
subtext: "The processor will cleanup unused cached entries after the duration specified by `max_staleness`. If `max_staleness` is not set, cached entries may persist indefinitely, leading to potential memory bloat over time."
