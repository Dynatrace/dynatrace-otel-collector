  Please note that the `k8s.container.name` attribute will only be added if the pod from which the incoming
  signal has been received contains only one container, or if the ingested signal contains the `k8s.container.id` resource attribute.
  Otherwise, the k8sattributes processor will not be able to correctly associate the correct container.
