### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `envprovider`: Restricts Environment Variable names.  Environment variable names must now be ASCII only and start with a letter or an underscore, and can only contain underscores, letters, or numbers. ([#9531](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/9531))
- `confighttp`: Apply MaxRequestBodySize to the result of a decompressed body ([#10289](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/pull/10289))
  When using compressed payloads, the Collector would verify only the size of the compressed payload. 
  This change applies the same restriction to the decompressed content. As a security measure, a limit of 20 MiB was added, which makes this a breaking change. 
  For most clients, this shouldn't be a problem, but if you often have payloads that decompress to more than 20 MiB, you might want to either configure your
  client to send smaller batches (recommended), or increase the limit using the MaxRequestBodySize option.
- `k8sattributesprocessor`: Move `k8sattr.rfc3339` feature gate to stable. ([#33304](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/33304))

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `batchprocessor`: ensure attributes are set on cardinality metadata metric ([#9674](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/9674))
- `batchprocessor`: Fixing processor_batch_metadata_cardinality which was broken in v0.101.0 ([#10231](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/10231))
- `batchprocessor`: respect telemetry level for all metrics ([#10234](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/pull/10234))

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `filelog, journald, tcp, udp, syslog, windowseventlog receivers`: The internal logger has been changed from zap.SugaredLogger to zap.Logger. ([#32177](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/32177))
This should not have any meaningful impact on most users but the logging format for some logs may have changed.
