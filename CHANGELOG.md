### ðŸ›‘ Breaking changes ðŸ›‘

- `exporter/debug`: Disable sampling by default ([#9921](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/9921)).
  To restore the behavior that was previously the default, set `sampling_thereafter` to `500`.

### ðŸš© Deprecations ðŸš© ###

- `healthcheckextension`: Remove incorrect logic behind `check_collector_pipeline` config ([#33469](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/33469)).
  This logic incorrectly set the pipeline to OK after waiting for enough callbacks from the
  opencensus library to be called. As this was broken, I'm removing it to remove the dependency
  on opencensus as well. Improvements will be available via healthcheckv2 extension.


### ðŸ§° Bug fixes ðŸ§°

- `filelogreceiver`: Container parser should add k8s metadata as resource attributes and not as log record attributes ([#33341](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/33341))
- `prometheusreceiver`: Fall back to scrape config job/instance labels for aggregated metrics without instance/job labels ([#32555](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/32555))

</details>

### ðŸ’¡ Enhancements ðŸ’¡

- `examples`: Added an example for using the syslog receiver, as well as integration tests for the added example. (#136)

### This release addresses CVE-2024-36129 ([GHSA-c74f-6mfw-mm4v](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/security/advisories/GHSA-c74f-6mfw-mm4v)) fully

### ðŸ›‘ Breaking changes ðŸ›‘

- `envprovider`: Restricts Environment Variable names.  Environment variable names must now be ASCII only and start with a letter or an underscore, and can only contain underscores, letters, or numbers. ([#9531](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/9531))
- `confighttp`: Apply MaxRequestBodySize to the result of a decompressed body ([#10289](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/pull/10289))
  When using compressed payloads, the Collector would verify only the size of the compressed payload. 
  This change applies the same restriction to the decompressed content. As a security measure, a limit of 20 MiB was added, which makes this a breaking change. 
  For most clients, this shouldn't be a problem, but if you often have payloads that decompress to more than 20 MiB, you might want to either configure your
  client to send smaller batches (recommended), or increase the limit using the MaxRequestBodySize option.
- `k8sattributesprocessor`: Move `k8sattr.rfc3339` feature gate to stable. ([#33304](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/33304))

### ðŸ§° Bug fixes ðŸ§°

- `batchprocessor`: ensure attributes are set on cardinality metadata metric ([#9674](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/9674))
- `batchprocessor`: Fixing processor_batch_metadata_cardinality which was broken in v0.101.0 ([#10231](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/10231))
- `batchprocessor`: respect telemetry level for all metrics ([#10234](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/pull/10234))
- `configrpc`: Use own compressors for zstd (#10323)
   Before this change, the zstd compressor we used didn't respect the max message size. This addresses CVE-2024-36129 (GHSA-c74f-6mfw-mm4v) on `configgrpc`.

### ðŸ›‘ Breaking changes ðŸ›‘

- `filelog, journald, tcp, udp, syslog, windowseventlog receivers`: The internal logger has been changed from zap.SugaredLogger to zap.Logger. ([#32177](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/32177))
This should not have any meaningful impact on most users but the logging format for some logs may have changed.

### ðŸ’¡ Enhancements ðŸ’¡

- `filelogreceiver`: Add container operator parser ([#31959](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/31959))
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Support GCP Bare Metal Solution in resource detection processor. ([#32985](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/32985))
- `processor/transform`: Allow common where clause ([#27830](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/27830))

</details>

### ðŸ’¡ Enhancements ðŸ’¡

- Add section to list which container registries are available to pull images from ([#188](https://github.com/Dynatrace/dynatrace-otel-collector/pull/188))
- Use chloggen to generate changelog entries ([#191](https://github.com/Dynatrace/dynatrace-otel-collector/pull/191))
