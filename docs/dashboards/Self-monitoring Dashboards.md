# OpenTelemetry collector self-monitoring dashboards

> [!WARNING]
> The documentation for setting up self monitoring of the OpenTelemetry collector have been moved to the [Dynatrace Docs](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/otel-collector-self-monitoring).
> This documentation describes how to use the self-monitoring dashboards by installing the OpenTelemetry self-monitoring app in Dynatrace.
> If you would like to manually import the dashboards by uploading the JSON files instead, you can use the JSON files included in this directory by [following the steps in the Dynatrace documentation](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/dashboards-use#dashboards-upload).
