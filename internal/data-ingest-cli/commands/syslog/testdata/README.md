# Syslog test data

All files in this directory can be used as the basis for custom syslog payloads
to be sent to the syslog receiver. The payloads were taken from examples used to
test the parser used for the syslog receiver, so they should be sufficiently
comprehensive as a basis.

## Attribution

All payloads in this directory were derived from test cases provided in the `syslogtest` package [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/stanza/operator/parser/syslog/syslogtest/data.go#L46).
